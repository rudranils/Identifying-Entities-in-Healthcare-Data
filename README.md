# Identifying Entities in Healthcare Data

## Problem Statement
We have been given such a data set in which a lot of text is written related to the medical domain. As we can see in the dataset, there are a lot of diseases that can be mentioned in the entire dataset and their related treatments are also mentioned implicitly in the text. Foe example, if the disease is cancer, its treatment can be identified as chemotherapy.

But, it is not explicitly mentioned in the dataset about the diseases and their treatment, but somehow, we need to build an algorithm to map the diseases and their respective treatment.
